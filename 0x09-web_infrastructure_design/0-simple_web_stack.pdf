1) What is a server: A server is a computer or a software system that provides services, resources, or functionality to other computers or programs, known as clients, over a network. In the context of web hosting, a server typically refers to a physical or virtual machine that hosts websites, applications, databases, or other services. 
2) What is the role of the domain name: A domain name is a human-readable label that represents the numeric IP address of a server on the internet. It serves as an easy-to-remember alias for the IP address, allowing users to access websites and other internet resources using memorable names instead of numeric addresses. 
3) What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com: The www record in www.foobar.com typically refers to a CNAME (Canonical Name) DNS record. This record points the www subdomain to the root domain (foobar.com), allowing users to access the website using both www.foobar.com and foobar.com. 
4) What is the role of the web server: The web server's role is to handle incoming HTTP requests from clients (users' computers or devices) and serve web pages, static content, or forward dynamic content requests to the application server. It manages the communication between the client's browser and the web application. 
5) What is the role of the application server: The application server hosts the application codebase and is responsible for processing dynamic content requests from the web server. It executes application logic, interacts with databases, generates dynamic web pages, and sends responses back to the web server for delivery to the client. 
6) What is the role of the database: The database stores and manages data used by the application. It provides a structured mechanism for organizing, storing, and retrieving data efficiently. The database server manages data integrity, security, and access control, allowing multiple users or applications to interact with the data concurrently. 
7) What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website: The server communicates with the user's computer over the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or HTTPS (HTTP Secure) protocol. These protocols define the rules and standards for transmitting and receiving data over the internet, enabling the exchange of web pages, resources, and other content between the server and the client. 

The issues with this Infrastructure includes:
 1) Single Point of Failure (SPOF): This infrastructure has a single server hosting both the web server, application server, and database. Any failure in hardware or software components of this server could lead to downtime for the entire website, resulting in loss of access for users. 
2) Downtime when maintenance needed: During maintenance tasks such as deploying new code or updates, the web server may need to be restarted, causing downtime for the website. This can disrupt user access and impact user experience, especially during peak usage hours. 
3) Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic: The infrastructure's single server setup may struggle to handle high volumes of incoming traffic, as it's not designed for horizontal scalability. As a result, the website may become slow or unresponsive during periods of increased traffic, leading to a poor user experience and potential loss of customers.
